myo
===

This contains the work I have done with the Myo Armband 

I have created two directories for seperating what I have finished and what I am working on. 

Each working set of scripts will contain their own README on how it works and anything you might need to do or be wary of to get up and running

Please let me know if you see any bugs or mistakes I am learning Lua along the way. 

If you would like to work on anything hit me up. I think the Myo is going to be a cool technology in IoT. I want to help it get into that space before it gets crowded
